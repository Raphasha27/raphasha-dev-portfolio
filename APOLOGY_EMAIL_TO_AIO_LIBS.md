# Email to Send to aio-libs Organization

**To:** aio-libs maintainers (reply to their block notification email)  
**Subject:** Apology and Resolution - Automated Activity from @Raphasha27

---

Dear aio-libs Team,

I sincerely apologize for the automated activity originating from my GitHub account (@Raphasha27) that resulted in the block. I understand this caused disruption to your organization.

## What Happened

I manage 194 repositories with automated dependency management tools (Dependabot, GitHub Actions) configured to run weekly with aggressive PR limits (5 per repo). This unintentionally created spam-like behavior across the GitHub ecosystem, including your organization's repositories.

## Actions Taken Immediately

I have already implemented the following changes to prevent this from happening again:

1. ✅ **Reduced Dependabot frequency:** Changed from `weekly` to `monthly` across all repositories
2. ✅ **Lowered PR limits:** Reduced `open-pull-requests-limit` from `5` to `2` per repository
3. ✅ **Review scheduled:** Auditing all 194 repos to disable unnecessary automation
4. ✅ **Fork cleanup:** Will remove any unused forks of external projects, including aio-libs repos

## Commitment Going Forward

- I will manually review all dependency updates before allowing automation
- I will ensure no automated tools interact with external organizations without explicit intent
- I will follow GitHub's best practices for automation and respect rate limits
- I will not fork or contribute to aio-libs projects unless I have genuine, sustained contributions

## Request for Unblock

I respectfully request that you unblock my account once these changes are verified. I deeply respect the work you do on aiohttp, aioredis, and the entire aio-libs ecosystem, and I apologize for the inconvenience my automated tools caused.

If there are additional steps I should take or policies I should follow, please let me know and I will comply immediately.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

**Best regards,**
